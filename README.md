#MarksForJustice
A web app that displays a world map, showing where acts of injustice occur. Users anywhere can report injustice by marking it on the map to bring awareness to the public. Marks can be given a title and a description. The description input is great for summarizing and/or sharing information about charities and organizations for social justice.

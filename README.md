#MarksForJustice
A web app that displays a world map and shows where acts of injustice and discrimination are prevalent. Users anywhere can report injustice by marking it on the map to bring awareness to the public and to reflect the oppression and inequality that they have been exposed to.

Marks can be given a title and a description.
The description input is great for summarizing and/or sharing information about charities and organizations that help to bring social justice and break any barriers that prevent a person to live freely.
